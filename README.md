# automariadbbackup

This is a fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup

Initial goals for the fork:
- include zstandard compression because it is fast and good
- MySQL is dead; long live MariaDB! (convert naming as required)

Future goals:
- Make it nice and easy to run from Bacula
